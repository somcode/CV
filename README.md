A Junior full stack developer and recent graduate of Makers Academy, with a background in mathematics and previous experience in education, and Accounting Analyst.
I was selected as a [Fellowship student](https://fellowship.makersacademy.com) from a competitive field after spending few months teaching myself how to code.
I'm looking forward to joining a supportive environment where I can continue to develop my technical skills.


## <a name="skills">Skills</a>


#### Communication
The use of XP practises meant that we were assigned a new pair partner each day. This was something that I really got a lot out of and I believe it helped progress our learning a lot more than if we were on our own.


#### Teamwork
In my past experience it was very important to keep everyone well-informed. During a particular month with an unexpected amount of work I found this incredibly useful and especially important when I had to avoid overlapping tasks in the team. I was working in a team of 10 experts with daily, Weekly, and monthly deadlines.


#### Logical thinking
Studying Maths helped me develop skills in logical thinking, problem-solving and decision-making.
My years in accounting analyst have also played to my analytical strength, preparing me for life as a developer.

#### Attention to details
Having a keen eye for the fine details has been vital in my previous roles.
During my time working as a member of the accounts team at University I learnt to be very precise, every single piece of information had to be just right. During our monthly closed periods accuracy was key. The accounts had to be kept up to date and ready to be presented without delays, it was my responsibility to take care of the final draft and make sure everything was perfect.
