## Somayeh Alimohammadi


Hello prospective employers! I'm Somayeh, currently in my extensive training to become a Junior Developer. I have got a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Applied Mathematics and can clearly feel how that helps me to analyse and understand the structure, architecture, and the concept of the various codes efficiently.
I enjoy working in challenging environments and developing or learning in close interaction and cooperation with colleagues. For this reason, I have chosen a career in Software development with its continuous problems and infinite depth of learning. I have repeatedly demonstrated my ability to teach myself new skills and then excel in adapting to any situation and in turn, passing my learning on to others.
Overcoming a new challenge in my learning process makes me more enthusiastic to learn and do more.
It is extremely important to me that my coding skills be of the highest quality and in the long run I would like to be to address main challenges we face in my area of expertise.
I am looking to work with an innovative team developing products for its customers with passion to write clean codes combined with creative thinking. I would like to follow best practices from the initial implantation stage to final delivery of demonstrable products to the costumer and strengthen my interpersonal and professional skills on regular basis. 



## Skills

I am a team player. To me, it is essentially important to make sure having a clear consensus on the direction and an agreement on the mission for an efficient collaboration. I enjoy understanding different people's motivators and aligning a team around a shared goal.
